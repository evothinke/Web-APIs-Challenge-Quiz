<h1>Web APIs Challenge: Quiz</h1>

<h2>The Goal:</h2>
- Build a timed quiz with multiple choice questions.
- For each incorrect answer, substract 10 seconds from the countdown timer.
- At the end of the quiz, ask the user to enter their initials that would be stored in the localStorage memory and display them in descending order based on score.


<h2>The Process:</h2>

First I started by breaking down the functionality of the app, so I can understand what variables to declare, what functions to create and what conditions to write.
Then I declared the variables and the data objects like the student data and the main questions with answers.
The next step was to create the functions that would handle the quiz showing and saving the data.
Overall, the challenge was interesting and engaging. 


<h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>

- I decided to use other questions instead of code questions.
- There is a "cheat mode" checkbox that will show the correct answer for each question. When activated, it will show the answer below.
- The countdown timer will substract 10 seconds each time an answer is incorrect.
- The user data will be stored in the localStorage and shown when the Check Scores button is pressed.
